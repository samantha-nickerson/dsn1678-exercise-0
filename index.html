<p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>

<p>The usually deep purple roots of <strong>beetroot</strong> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a
cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and
shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
